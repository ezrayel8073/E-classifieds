E-Classifieds is a web-based platform that allows users to post and browse classified ads across multiple categories like electronics, real estate, automobiles, and services. The application enables sellers to create ads, buyers to search and filter posts, and users to interact in a secure and organized manner. This project was developed to simplify the process of connecting individuals and businesses for both buying and selling items or services.

**Problem Statement**
